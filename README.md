Overview of project:

Project:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

 1. Store Student Information
   - Collect and store student names and their corresponding grades for each subject.
   - Ensure that the program allows easy addition, update, and retrieval of student information.

2. Track Grades Across Subjects
   - Record grades for multiple subjects for each student.
   - Allow for adding, modifying, and deleting grades for any subject or student.

3. Calculate Average Grades
   - Compute the average grade for each student across all subjects or specific subjects.
   - Support the calculation of weighted averages, if necessary (for example, if some subjects contribute more to the overall grade).

4. Grade Classification
   - Based on the grade average, the program should classify the student's performance (e.g., A, B, C, F) using a grading scale.
   - Provide a performance summary or feedback based on the calculated grades.

 5. Allow for Input of Grades
   - Allow teachers or administrators to input grades easily via a user-friendly interface (command line, GUI, etc.).
   - Implement checks to ensure that input is valid (for example, numeric values for grades).

 6. Display Grades and Performance
   - Display a list of all students with their grades for each subject and their average grade.
   - Show a summary of all studentsâ€™ performance, including pass/fail status or grade classification.

 7. Data Storage and Retrieval
   - Allow the grades and student data to be saved persistently (in a file, database, or a simple text file) so that data is not lost when the program is closed.
   - Implement a way to load and retrieve data upon restarting the program.

8. Search and Sort Data
   - Search for specific students or grades based on their name, subject, or grade.
   - Sort the data by student names or average grades to make it easier to analyze.

 9. Handle Multiple Students and Subjects
   - Manage data for multiple students and support a variable number of subjects.
   - Support adding new students or new subjects to the system dynamically.

 10. Error Handling
   - Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric grades, missing data, or trying to access non-existing students or subjects.
   - Provide clear error messages to guide the user in correcting issues.

 11. Provide a Simple User Interface
   - Provide an **interactive command-line interface** or a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users (e.g., teachers, administrators) to navigate through the program easily.
   - Make it intuitive for users to perform basic tasks like adding students, entering grades, and viewing reports.

12. Flexibility and Extensibility
   - The program should be flexible enough to add new features in the future, such as:
     - Allowing for grade adjustments.
     - Adding additional calculations, like weighted grades, class ranking, or predicting final scores.
